# Railway programming

This repository provides a quick way to start playing with Railway oriented programming in C#. Just clone the repository and start hacking away.

The contents of `Railway.cs` come from the project [AltNetRop] by Habaneroofdoom and are heavily influenced by the excellent work of Scott Wlaschin. I highly recommend watching the presentation [Railway oriented programming] if you have not seen it already.

## Running the application

    dotnet run -p App

## Running the tests

    dotnet run -p Tests
