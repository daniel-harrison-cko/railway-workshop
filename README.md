# Railway programming

This repository provides a quick way to start playing with Railway oriented programming in C#. Just clone the repository and start hacking away.

The contents of `Railway.cs` come from the [AltNetRop](https://github.com/habaneroofdoom/AltNetRop) project and are heavily influenced by the excellent work of Scott Wlaschin. I highly recommend watching [his talk](https://vimeo.com/113707214) on Railway oriented programming if you have not seen it already.
